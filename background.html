        <p class="BackgroundSummary">In 2015, my cousin was taken from her family from a drug overdose. She left behind two daughters, leaving her parents to take care of the girls. I have seen how drugs have impacted my family and it’s an awful experience. Over the past 20 years, the number of drug overdoses has increased dramatically. Last year alone, there were 72,000 deaths caused by drug overdoses.</p>
        <p class="BackgroundSummary">My research starts in 2000, because any data before this is very difficult to find, it wasn’t recorded before then. I will be focusing on the ages of fifteen to forty four because this age group, historically, has the most drug use. Through my research, I have seen that every year the number of drug deaths increases in every age group. I have also noticed there is an apparent correlation between overdose deaths and the GDP rate of the economy.</p>
