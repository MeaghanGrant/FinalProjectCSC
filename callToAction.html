        <h1 class="ActionHeader">Looking at the Graph</h1>
            <p>The total number of drug overdose deaths, for the most part, is always increasing. The only time it was decreasing was when the economy took a downturn from 2006-2009. When we look closer at the graph, we can see whenever there’s a positive GDP rate in the economy, drug overdose deaths increase.</p>

        <h1 class="ActionHeader">The Issue</h1>
            <p>For the most part, the GDP of our economy is usually positive. There are some exceptions but it’s usually above a negative rate. Based on the data in the graph, drug overdose deaths increase when the GDP is positive. If our economy stays on this trend of the GDP staying positive, we can expect to see the number of overdose deaths continue to increase.</p>

        <h1 class="ActionHeader">Possible Solutions</h1>
            <p>-Inform the Public- By informing people about the epidemic, they will understand this is a bigger problem then what they previously had thought, spreading awareness of this issue.</p>
            <p>-Teletherapy- Taking with a doctor and making a plan over the phone, instead of in person.</p>
            <p>-Improving Treatment Facilities- Improving the access and experience to draw people to get help. Having more people get treatment will also increase the research on addiction so we can better understand it.</p>
            <p>-Promoting Overdose Reversing Drugs- These drugs can save people who have overdosed.</p>   
            <p>According to American Addiction Centers, 30% of people treatment are successful, the other 70% drop out before they complete the treatment. Even though the success rate is low, promoting treatment could have saved 30% of the people who died in 2018.</p>

    <div id="ActionBox4">
        <h1 class="ActionHeader">Possible Reasoning</h1>
            <p> One possible reason for this issue is when the economy is doing well, more people have jobs and they have money to spend on whatever they want. When people lose their jobs (when the economy is bad), they don’t have the money to buy drugs. This could cause the number of overdose deaths to decrease when the GDP rate gets below zero.</p>
